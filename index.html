    <h1>Welcome to Systers' Open Source!</h1>
        <p>Systers is an international community encouraging the participation of all women involved in technology.</p>    
    
        <p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, work experience, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

    <h2>JOIN SYSTERS</h2>
        <p> In order to engage with the community, you can sign up on <a href="http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/">Systers Open Source Slack</a> or subscribe to our <a href="http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers-dev">systers-dev mailing list</a> and send out an introductory email.</p>

    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>Our projects focus on impacting users and communities by improving their lives with technology. We use various development languages and technologies, and encourage our contributors to solve new challenges. We’ve created a repository on GitHub so that contributors can publish and store their code, connect with other open source communities, and learn how to store revisions of code like Git.</p>

    <h3>Peace Corps Projects</h3>
        <p>The Peace Corps has had nearly 220,000 volunteers (PCVs) in 151 countries around the world since its creation in 1961. Many great technology projects are started for the Peace Corps, usually at hackathons, but they are rarely complete enough to deploy to the PCVs who need technology. Systers take on these projects, completes them, then works with Peace Corps administrators to get them tested and deployed in the field.</p>

    <h3>Systers Projects</h3>
        <p>Systers, an Anita Borg Institute (ABI) Community, has very specific needs with managing volunteers. We have the Volunteer Management System and Systers Portal to help Systers and volunteers to make an engaged connection. We also maintain the Systers GNU Mailman and apply our customized features to the latest release. Our customized version, is very complex and has a higher difficulty level for developers. We’re also working on a new project to help manage our community's meetups.</p>

    <h2>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
        <p>Systers participates in several Open Source Internships, including <a href=”https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/”>Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href=”https://www.outreachy.org/”>Outreachy</a>, and <a href=”https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/”>Ruby Girls Summer of Code</a> to encourage new people to contribute to our projects and become part of our community.</p>

    <h3>Don’t Know Code?</h3>
    <p>We need your help too! Look for these labels in the issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Documentation: Documentation is a huge part of a successful open source project. Organizations need documentation to help attract users and new contributors.</li>
        <li>Research: An organization may need help crunching numbers or analyzing feedback to better understand what the users want or need.</li>
        <li>Outreach: Outreach is how open source projects attract new users and developers. This includes writing blog posts or making videos, organizing meetups, or helping others learn about the project.</li>
        <li>Training: Teach others how to use the project. This is a specialized form of outreach or documentation.</li>
        <li>User Interface: User interface can include many types of tasks including designing new visual aspects of a webpage or creating a new logo for the project. It may also include various accessibility opportunities to help make the project easier for people who are visually impaired.</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance: Finding and verifying bugs is an important part of software development.</li>
        <li>Other: If you have an idea that may help an organization, reach out to them and let them know! Sometimes the best task is one that the organization hasn’t even considered yet.</li>
    </ul>
