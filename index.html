    <div class="header"><h1>Welcome to Systers' Open Source!</h1></div>
        <p>Systers is an international community encouraging the participation of all women involved in technology.</p>    
    
        <p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, work experience, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

    <div class="subheader"><h2>JOIN SYSTERS</h2></div>
        <p> In order to engage with the community, you can sign up on <a href="http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/">Systers Open Source Slack</a> or subscribe to our <a href="http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers-dev">systers-dev mailing list</a> and send out an introductory email.</p>

    <div class="subheader"><h2>PROJECTS</h2></div>
        <p>Our projects focus on impacting users and communities by improving their lives with technology. We use various development languages and technologies, and encourage our contributors to learn new skills and solve new challenges. We’ve created a repository on GitHub so that contributors can publish and store their code, connect with other open source communities, and learn how to store revisions of code like Git. Github tracks your personal contributions, so you can share them as part of your portfolio.</p>

    <h3>Peace Corps Projects</h3>
        <p>The Peace Corps has had nearly 220,000 volunteers (PCVs) in 151 countries around the world since its creation in 1961. Many great technology projects are started for the Peace Corps, usually at hackathons, but they are rarely complete enough to deploy to the PCVs who need technology. Systers take on these projects, completes them, then works with Peace Corps administrators to get them tested and deployed in the field.</p>

        <p>Please note that these projects have been archived until AnitaB.org finds new contacts within Peace Corps to finish and test these projects in the field.</p>

    <h3>Systers Projects</h3>
        <p>Systers, an Anita Borg Institute (ABI) Community, has very specific needs with managing volunteers. We have the Volunteer Management System and Systers Portal to help Systers and volunteers to make an engaged connection. We also maintain the Systers GNU Mailman and apply our customized features to the latest release. Our customized version, is very complex and has a higher difficulty level for developers. We’re also working on a new project to help manage our community's meetups.</p>

    <div class="subheader"><h2>WELCOME NEWCOMERS</h2></div>
        <p>Each project has issues labeled "First Timers Only," try working on one of those for your first pull request.</p> 
        <p>Below there are tutorials and cheatsheets from Git to Glitch to Markdown. As well as information on how to help, even if you're not a developer.  If you need help reach out on the #questions Slack channel or in the channel for the specific project you have questions about (#portal for the portal repo, etc.)</p>

    <h3>Tutorials and Other Helpful Places</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Here’s a 15 minute tutorial from GitHub to learn <a href=”https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1”>Git</a> or use this <a href=”https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron”>awesome tutorial</a>.</li>
        <li>After you’ve got a basic understanding of Git, work through some <a href=”https://guides.github.com/”>Github Tutorials</a></li>
        <li><a href=”https://glitch.com/about/”>Glitch</a> gives you a way to start coding without having to set up a development environment. Just sign up, click create a new website, and choose import from Github from the advanced options. Then you can start coding!</li>
        <li>Documentation on GitHub is written in markdown. It’s used in comments for pull requests and issues, gists, and many files. Here’s a great <a href=”https://www.markdowntutorial.com/”>tutorial</a> and here’s a quick <a href=”https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/”>cheat sheet</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Don’t Know Code?</h3>
    <p>We need your help too! Look for these labels in the issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Documentation: Documentation is a huge part of a successful open source project. Organizations need documentation to help attract users and new contributors.</li>
        <li>Research: An organization may need help crunching numbers or analyzing feedback to better understand what the users want or need.</li>
        <li>Outreach: Outreach is how open source projects attract new users and developers. This includes writing blog posts or making videos, organizing meetups, or helping others learn about the project.</li>
        <li>Training: Teach others how to use the project. This is a specialized form of outreach or documentation.</li>
        <li>User Interface: User interface can include many types of tasks including designing new visual aspects of a webpage or creating a new logo for the project. It may also include various accessibility opportunities to help make the project easier for people who are visually impaired.</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance: Finding and verifying bugs is an important part of software development.</li>
        <li>Other: If you have an idea that may help an organization, reach out to them and let them know! Sometimes the best task is one that the organization hasn’t even considered yet.</li>
    </ul>
